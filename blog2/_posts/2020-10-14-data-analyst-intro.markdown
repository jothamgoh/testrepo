Welcome to the ebook on becoming a data analyst. Who is a data analyst? It's someone who uses data to drive business value. With no prior data experience or programming background, I scrambled and stumbled my way into data and ultimately received multiple offers from some of the biggest companies.   

I did this a few years back, and I believe so can you. This ebook / guide is a continual project which synthesizes everything that I have learnt, and documents my journey transitioning to a career in data. You can start reading the chapters below, and subscribe to get informed as the remaining chapters are published.
